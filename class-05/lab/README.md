# Cookie Stand Tycoon

What good is being a Cookie Stand Tycoon if you've got no style?

The web designer's side hussle just got bought out and they've moved on.

The dream of a well designed cookie stand adminstration are crumbling!

The current site is functional but completely unstyled.

Do you think you have what it takes to get something serviceable whipped up this afternoon?

Here's a general idea, but please add as much pizzazz as you see fit.
